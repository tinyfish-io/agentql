This is an example lowering the risk of being detected by a anti-bot system by running AgentQL in stealth mode.

## Run the script

  - If you already have SDK installed, make sure to update to the latest version: `pip3 install agentql --upgrade`
- Save this python file locally as **stealth_mode.py**
- Run the following command from the project's folder:

```bash
python3 stealth_mode.py
```
